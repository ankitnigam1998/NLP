As of 2018, the United States had a rail network that was only one-seventh the size of Spain's rail network and one-fifteenth the size of China's rail network. This means that it would be much more difficult and expensive to build a high-speed train network in America than it would be in countries with larger rail networks."" """" ""The second reason why America cannot have high-speed trains is that the United States does not have any high-speed rail lines currently operating. The only high-speed rail line in America currently operating is the Acela Express line, which is a train that travels at speeds of up to 270 miles per hour (or 435 kilometers per hour). However, the Acela Express line is only operational on a limited section of the rail network and it is not currently available to serve all parts of the United States."" """" ""Finally, the third reason why America cannot have high-speed trains is that the American people are not currently willing to invest in the infrastructure necessary to build a high-speed rail network. The United States has a very low rate of railway infrastructure investment, which means that it would be much more expensive and difficult to build a high-speed rail network in America than it would be in countries with larger rail networks.""",gpt3

This trend is especially evident in younger generations, with the number of marriages among adults aged 18 to 29 going up by more than 50%."" """" ""These statistics may seem like a good thing, but they may also be a sign of the coming marriage apocalypse. In fact, there are a number of reasons why the marriage apocalypse may be coming. One reason is that the traditional role of marriage has changed. In the past, people thought of marriage as a way of binding two people together for the rest of their lives. But today, many people have different expectations for marriage."" """" ""For example, many people now view marriage as a way of finding emotional support. Others view it as a way of sharing household responsibilities. And still others view it as a way of having a ___. In fact, marriages today are more likely to be based on shared interests and common goals than on a traditional marriage based on love."" """" ""Another reason why the marriage apocalypse may be coming is that there are too many divorce rates. In the past, people thought of divorce as a BAD thing. But today, more and more people are viewing divorce as a way of solving problems. After all, why go through the hassle of trying to fix a marriage that is already broken?""

Nic Cage's character, Master, showers and bathes nude, but there's no sexual overtones to any of it. In fact, Master is almost fatherly towards his young protégée (played by Emma Stone), and there's a sense of innocence and spirituality to the nudity."" """" ""Similarly, HBO's popular television show Game of Thrones features more realistic and natural nudity than ever before. This season, for instance, we've seen nudity in the context of sex (between Cersei Lannister and Jaime Lannister) and violence (between Barristan Selmy and Ser Jorah Mormont). But there's also nudity that's simply seen as part of the natural world (the Frey girl bathing naked in a river)."" """" ""So, in general, nudity in media is becoming more realistic and less sexualized. This is probably a good thing—after all, nudity shouldn't be used solely to titillate viewers.
