It holds that a person should have the right to decide what is done to their own body, and that includes the right to terminate a pregnancy. This argument is important in recognizing and protecting the fundamental right of bodily autonomy that people have.""",instructgpt
1,"""CMV: The best voting system is ranked choice with a condorcet selection and runoff""""."" """" ""Ranked choice voting with a Condorcet selection and runoff is a great voting system that allows you to weigh your preferences and ensure that the outcome most accurately reflects the will of the people. It eliminates the need for a traditional runoff election, making it much more efficient and cost effective. In addition, it encourages higher voter turnout, as voters are more likely to come out to the polls when they know their votes will be accurately reflected. Ranked choice also promotes more positive campaigns, as candidates must focus more on policy rather than attacking their opponents. Overall, ranked choice voting with a Condorcet selection and runoff is a great option that allows for accurate representation of the people's will.""",instructgpt

"""" ""I agree that using extreme examples to support a cause is not helpful and can do more harm than good. It is important for the LGBT community to focus on presenting their cause in a positive light and to draw attention to the real issues they are fighting for. Rather than resorting to violent metaphors or fear tactics, the LGBT community should focus on advocating for their rights in a respectful and constructive way. This means having honest conversations with people in order to educate them on the reality of the situation and challenge any preconceived beliefs they may have. This can also include creating more inclusive spaces, such as LGBT-friendly events or organizations, and supporting each other in times of need.""",instructgpt

Depression is a serious mental health condition, and misdiagnosis can lead to ineffective treatment and even further complications. Diagnosing people with depression who are not clinically symptomatic defeats the purpose of diagnosis and can do more harm than good.""",instructgpt

Pornography is increasingly seen as something to be enjoyed by all genders and orientations, and as a way to explore and express sexuality. Due to this shift in perception, the demand for porn is likely to remain high for a long time to come.""",instructgpt

Additionally, vinyl may be better than digital formats when it comes to the physicality of the storage medium and its ability to be used as a visual medium in the form of art.""",instructgpt
15,"""CMV: Support for the phrase ""trans women are women"" is completely orthogonal to trans social policy"""""" """" ""CMV: Absolutely. Any and all support for trans rights should include the recognition that trans women are women. Gender identity is an integral and intrinsic part of human identity and should be respected as such. Social policies should reflect this understanding and ensure that trans people are treated as equal members of society, with access to the same basic rights and opportunities as any other person.""",instructgpt

17,"""CMV: I believe that U.S. Organ Donation Should be a soft Opt-out system, not opt-in."""""" """" ""Organ donation is a vital part of healthcare and a great way to give back to the community, potentially saving lives. With the current opt-in system, the majority of potential donors opt-out, meaning that the availability of organs for those in need is drastically reduced. Soft opt-out systems have been shown to drastically increase the availability of organs for those in need. Under a soft opt-out system, all individuals are considered potential donors unless they actively opt-out, thereby increasing the number of organs available to those in need. Additionally, this system provides a great way for individuals to give back to the community, potentially saving lives.""",instructgpt
18,"""CMV: It�s not people�s individual fault they�re obese."""""" """" ""While it is true that obesity can be caused by many factors, such as genetics or environmental influences, it is still important for individuals to take personal responsibility for the choices they make when it comes to their health. This includes making healthy food and lifestyle choices, such as exercising regularly and eating nutritious meals. Ultimately, individuals have the power to make changes in their lives to improve their health and reduce their risk of obesity.""",instructgpt
19,"""CMV: ""Trumps"" Banking Deregulation was NOT a bad thing"""""" """" ""CMV: While there may be disagreement over the extent of the deregulation of the banking industry that took place under the Trump administration, it is hard to argue that it was a bad thing overall. The deregulation of banks allowed them to provide more competitive services to consumers, leading to better lending and borrowing options, increased access to credit, and lower interest rates and fees. This ultimately created a more competitive banking environment, which resulted in more choices for consumers and less power for big banks and financial institutions.""",instructgpt
20,"""CMV: Both Political Parties are Equally Responsible for the Division in America and We Need More Civil Conversation"""""" """" ""CMV: While both political parties have contributed to the division in America, they are not equally responsible.

Additionally, we need more civil conversations between people of different political views if we want to bridge the divide. Promoting understanding, dialogue, and compromise is key to reducing the division in our nation.""",instructgpt

While remote work may present challenges to those who don't have access to the right technology and resources to work from home, it can also provide advantages to those who cannot attend work in person due to external factors, such as health conditions or disability. Remote work can also offer more flexibility and opportunities to those who might otherwise be unable to work, such as people with family commitments, or those who find it difficult to attend an office on a regular basis. Ultimately, the answer may depend on individual circumstances.""",instructgpt

Being popular in high school or college can have some advantages, such as having access to resources and more exposure to different activities.

Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide the importance of being popular in high school or college.""",instructgpt

"""" ""I agree that politicians, the news media, and social media mods do not do enough to remind people that disliking/hating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nations. There is an unfortunate tendency for people who have strong negative feelings toward foreign governments to demonize the citizens of those countries. This leads to stereotyping and can even result in discrimination and prejudice. Therefore, it is important for politicians, the news media, and social media mods to play an active role in reinforcing the message that disliking/hating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nations.""",instructgpt
24,"""CMV: Nurture has a much bigger effect on people than Nature, on all aspects of life."""""" """" ""CMV: There is significant debate about the relative importance of nurture and nature in human development. Both play a critical role in shaping individuals, and it is likely impossible to definitively say which plays a bigger effect. It is important to remember that nurture and nature both work together to influence psychological and behavioral aspects of development.""",instructgpt

26,"""CMV: The Federal government should not handle social issues"""""" """" ""CMV: It depends on the issue at hand. Some social issues may be better managed by the Federal government, while others may be better managed by local authorities or other entities.

"""" ""CMV: While North Korea adopts many communist policies, it is ultimately far too extreme and oppressive in its rule to be classified as a true Communist state. It is an ethno-fascist state that cloaks itself in Stalinist-Communism, rather than representing or embodying any genuine communist values.""",instructgpt

30,"""CMV: STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice."""""" """" ""There is no definitive answer to this question, since it depends on what criteria you are using to evaluate the efficacy of each voting system. Supporters of STAR voting might claim that it is better than Ranked Choice Voting because it allows voters to express more nuanced preferences and gives them the opportunity to reward or punish candidates they favor or oppose in a more meaningful way than Ranked Choice Voting. Supporters of Ranked Choice Voting might argue that it is better because it eliminates the need for multiple rounds of voting, makes strategic voting more difficult, and produces outcomes that are more representative of the preferences of the majority of voters. Ultimately, the best voting system is a matter of personal preference and depends on individual beliefs about the best way to ensure fair and accurate elections.""",instructgpt
31,"""CMV: Financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth rates"""""" """" ""CMV: While financial incentives may help to offset some of the costs associated with having a child, such as medical bills or childcare expenses, they will likely not be enough to address the root causes contributing to declining birth rates.

We should focus on domestic issues and work to create a healthier, more equitable society in our own country first.

We have to consider current and upcoming trends, and understand the consequences of all our decisions for the future.""

Abolitionists often advocate for the dismantling of the prison-industrial complex, which includes law enforcement, the courts, and the prison systems, among other components. Abolitionists propose alternative strategies for addressing harm that focus on community-building and accountability models.

There are a number of debates surrounding this issue, with some arguing that a new Cold War has emerged due to increased tensions between the West and Russia over several geopolitical issues, such as the crisis in Ukraine, Russian involvement in Syria, and competition in energy markets. Others, however, argue that such tensions do not necessarily constitute a new Cold War and that the two sides remain in a state of competition and rivalry rather than open conflict.""",instructgpt

Most employment is a means of imprisonment in a downward spiral of standard of living."""""" """" ""This is a difficult question of opinion. Everyone has a different value system, so it’s hard to say that USD isn’t worth it anymore. For some people, the tradeoff of working in exchange for money is worth it because they can purchase goods and services that improve their lives. On the other hand, many people feel that the amount of time it takes to earn money rarely reflects the amount of goods and services they need, which makes them feel like they are stuck in a never-ending cycle of having to work to survive. Ultimately, the value of dollar is subjective and depends on personal opinion.""",instructgpt

Incel is a term that has been used to describe a certain group of people and has been used incorrectly and frequently in a derogatory way. This can be hurtful and damaging to those who identify as Incels and to those who have to deal with the wider implications of this mislabeling.

"""" ""CMV: Envy and arrogance often go hand-in-hand when it comes to intelligence. It is true that the average person may be envious of those with higher intelligence, as they see it as an advantage, or something to strive for. At the same time, the average person may feel a sense of arrogance around their own intelligence, as they may believe they are above average. However, this is not necessarily true, and people should not be judged for their intelligence.

The project has been criticized for its reliance on often scarce government funding, which takes away from other important initiatives. Additionally, it does not focus on grassroots initiatives, which are often more cost-effective and more sustainable. In the long run, large-scale projects like the Willow Project often do not create lasting change and do not address the root causes of poverty, inequality, and environmental issues. Furthermore, since the project has an international scope, it has the potential to create unintended collateral damage in the communities it intends to help.

Additionally, the lower rates tend to mean that the loan is not inflation-adjusted, meaning that the worth of the money paid back over time is worth less due to the rising cost of goods and services.

590,"""The Fragility of Human Hubris: Analyzing the Theme of Humbleness in Ozymandias"""""" """" ""The poem “Ozymandias” by Percy Shelley is a powerful story about the transience of human achievement and the fragility of human hubris. Through the image of a giant statue of a long-dead king, whose visage and grandeur have been eroded by the passing of time, the poem poetically conveys the importance of humility. This essay will analyze how Shelley conveys the theme of humbleness through the use of imagery, symbolism, and tone in the poem."" """" ""Shelley’s use of imagery in the poem paints a vivid picture of the colossal statue that is at the center of the poem. The description of the statue’s crumbling, sun-bleached body, as well as its eroded face and grandeur suggests that time has eroded the statue’s once-great glory, emphasizing the futility of human hubris. The image of the statue’s feet being “scattered in the desert sand” serves to further cement the idea of the futility of ambition and hubris, as they are scattered in the same way as the ambitions of the long-dead king."" """" ""Similarly, Shelley uses symbolism in the poem to further convey the theme of humbleness. In particular, the image of a “pair of colossal legs of stone” serves as a symbol for the grand ambition of the long-dead king. The fact that his ambitions have been reduced to two mere legs of stone serves to suggest that even the greatest ambition is ultimately futile in the face of time’s relentless march. Additionally, the poem’s title, “Ozymandias,” can be seen as a symbolic reference to the idea that even the greatest of kings are ultimately vulnerable to the ravages of time."" """" ""Finally, Shelley’s use of tone throughout the poem also suggests the fragility of human ambition and hubris. He emphasizes the contrast between the speaker’s awe of the statue and its current sorry state. The poem’s end serves to further evoke the humbleness of man, as the speaker remarks that no matter how grand one’s ambition, its remains futile in the face of time’s inexorable march.""

This technique can be effective in both fiction and nonfiction writing, depending upon its use to create a particular atmosphere or emotion.

595,"""Understanding reader perceptions: Kushiel's Dart and the grooming of children in fantasy""""fiction"" """" ""The fantasy novel Kushiel's Dart has sparked controversy in recent years, from accusations of grooming children to a greater focus on explicit sexuality. The book focuses on the story of a young woman, Phedre, who is chosen at birth to become an anguisette, a sexual servant to the noble families of her homeland, Terre D'Ange. The novel contains several scenes of Phedre engaging in sexual activities with adults, and it is this that has led many to accuse the book's author, Jacqueline Carey, of grooming children through her work."" """" ""In order to understand reader perceptions of Kushiel's Dart, it is important to look at the context in which it was written. In the early 2000s, fantasy fiction was undergoing a resurgence, with such works as Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings creating a new wave of fans. Many readers, at the time, were looking for something new and different, and Kushiel's Dart certainly fit the bill. Its focus on sexual themes and its use of explicit language and imagery was a departure from the traditional fantasy stories of the past."" """" ""At the same time, however, readers also had to grapple with the fact that the novel's protagonist, Phedre, was a child. This put a spotlight on the issue of child grooming, which has since become a major social and cultural issue. This has created a divide among readers: while some see the novel as an exploration of sexual desire and relationships, others view it as exploitative and improper."" """" ""Ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide how they feel about Kushiel's Dart and its treatment of children in fantasy fiction. For those who can appreciate its literary merits, the novel can provide a provocative and thought-provoking exploration of themes of love, power, and desire. For those who cannot, however, the explicit and potentially dangerous content can be off-putting. Regardless, it is clear that the novel has sparked a great deal of debate and discussion and that it has become an important part of the fantasy fiction landscape.""",instructgpt

Generosity should not be interpreted solely in terms of giving physical goods, it should also encompass giving of one’s time, attention and counsel. Aristotle believes that it is virtuous to be generous and magnanimous in these areas."" """" ""In chapter one of the book, Aristotle states that generosity should not be confused with prodigality or profusion, since prodigality implies a reckless disregard for one’s own resources and profusion implies a lavish expenditure of one’s resources without adequate thought for the return to be gained from them. It should instead be seen as a way of demonstrating that one has the resources and self-possession to give of oneself without expecting anything in return."" """" ""In chapter two, Aristotle further clarifies the notion of generosity by saying that it should not be confused with liberality, which is a different kind of virtue. Liberality is a quality that involves giving out of one’s resources with a view to gaining some personal benefit from the transaction, such as fame or respect. Generosity on the other hand, is a more selfless virtue involving giving without expecting anything in return."" """" ""Aristotle’s view of generosity and magnanimity is based upon his belief that it is virtuous for someone to give of oneself without expecting anything in return. In addition, he also stresses the importance of acting with due consideration for the resources one has and not being wasteful. This kind of magnanimity is seen as a sign of one’s self-possession and virtue, and is considered to be a form of excellence.""",instructgpt

Nick is a witness to the extravagance of the other characters and lives a life of restraint in comparison. His observant nature allows the reader to experience Gatsby’s world and his interactions with other characters. He is an ideal narrator as his level-headedness provides an unbiased account of events. It gives the reader a unique perspective of an outside observer rather than a detached third-person perspective."" """" ""The passive nature of Nick’s narration is also a key element of why I find him to be an interesting character. This is especially evident when interacting with Gatsby. Although Nick is aware of Gatsby’s grand ambitions, he chooses to stand back and observe rather than get involved. His reserve also gives readers insight into the character’s personality. Nick’s tendency to stand back rather than get involved allows the reader to draw their own conclusions about the events occurring in Gatsby’s world."" """" ""Overall, I find Nick Carraway to be an interesting character in the Great Gatsby due to his passive nature as a narrator. His level-headed viewpoint provides readers with a unique perspective of Gatsby’s world and allows them to draw their own conclusions of the events occurring. His reserved nature also gives readers insight into his character and his relationships with the other characters.""",instructgpt

Some people have interpreted the play as a misogynistic text that promotes outdated gender roles, with men having power over women and women being subservient. However, if you take a close look at the text, it is easy to see that the women in the play often act in ways that seem to be more in control than the men. This is especially true in the case of Katherine, the “shrew” of the title, who is able to outwit her husband, Petruchio, several times.
