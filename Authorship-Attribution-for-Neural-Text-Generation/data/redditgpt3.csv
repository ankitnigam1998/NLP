As philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson points out, ""a person is not something that exists inside the body; it is something that the body exists to serve.""

1,"""CMV: The best voting system is ranked choice with a condorcet selection and runoff""""voting"" """" ""The best voting system according to this criterion is ranked choice with a condorcet selection and runoff voting. This system allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their second-choice votes are counted. The remaining candidates are then ranked according to their second-choice votes, and the candidate who receives the most votes is elected. If no candidate receives a majority of votes after the first round of voting, a runoff election is conducted between the two candidates with the highest vote totals.""",gpt3

Some of these examples include the use of quotes from Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and slavery. These quotes give the impression that the LGBT community is advocating for the same kind of horrific and evil things that were done to them. This is not only incorrect, but it also makes the LGBT community look bad and vile.""",gpt3

One of these misconceptions is that pornography is solely made for men and that women only enjoy watching it. This is simply not the case."" """" ""Pornography is still in high demand in the west, in part, because many people still do not understand the power dynamics involved in sexual interactions. These interactions are fundamentally between men and women, and when one sex is misrepresented or misunderstood in the media, it can have a negative impact on the overall sexual experience for both sexes."" """" ""There are many positive aspects to pornography being in high demand. For one, it has become a way for people of all genders and orientations to explore their sexual desires and fantasies. Additionally, it can be a way for people to safely explore their boundaries and explore their kinks and fetishes in a controlled and safe environment.""

Only then can we hope to see positive change in the way that sexual interactions are portrayed in our culture.""",gpt3

10,"""CMV: Incel Ideology is Deliberately Tailored to Lower Men�s Confidence to Exploit them for Financial or Political Gain"""""" """" ""There is no question that the Incel ideology is tailored to lower men's confidence in order to exploit them for financial or political gain. Incels preach a message of victimhood and self-pity, presenting themselves as the exclusive victim of society and the women who choose to date and associate with other men. This messaging encourages men to withdraw from society and to place their trust in the Incel communities as their only source of support."" """" ""Many Incels also promote MeToo and other forms of controversial ""women's empowerment"" rhetoric, which serves to further lower men's confidence. This counterproductive messaging undermines men's ability to seek outside accountability and support when they are struggling with mental health issues, which can in turn lead to even greater harm."" """" ""Incels also seek to create an eco-system of patronage in which they can bar women from entering the Incel communities, exploit them for financial or sexual gain, and control their social media accounts. This type of abuse is rampant in Incel communities, where men use their positions of power to bully and control women.""

"""" ""It's important to note that not everybody who works remotely is unhappy with the arrangement. For some people, it can be a great way to focus on their work and avoid distractions. However, for others, remote work can be a less efficient way to work because it takes more time to get work done.""

In fact, many countries that have instituted financial incentive schemes have seen little to no change in their birth rates. Advocates of financial incentive schemes often argue that they will increase the number of births by encouraging people to have more children, but this is not always the case. Some couples may decide to have fewer children in order to earn more money, and this would offset any increase in births that may have occurred as a result of the financial incentive scheme. Additionally, financial incentive schemes may actually have a negative impact on fertility rates if they create a sense of desperation in couples who are struggling to afford a child.""",gpt3
