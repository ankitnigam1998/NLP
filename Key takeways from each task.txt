1.) Key takeways from each task:

	a.) All the classifiers struggled to generate good f1 scores for the GPT2, GPT3, InstructGPT, and Human class labels. This indicates that these classes are difficult to differentiate:

The writing produced by these models is intended to be very close to human-written material, which may make it challenging to distinguish between GPT2, GPT3, InstructGPT, and Human class labels. The models are designed to produce writing that is identical to text authored by humans. As a result, the features that the classifiers extract from the text produced by these models may resemble those that they extract from text that was created by humans. Because of this, it is difficult for classifiers to differentiate between text produced by these models and text authored by people.

Another reason could be the use of the same or similar training data to train the different language models. For instance, GPT2 and GPT3 were trained on a large corpus of text data from the internet, including books, articles, and websites. InstructGPT, on the other hand, was trained on text data from scientific papers and technical manuals. As a result, the differences between these models may be subtle and difficult to detect using the features extracted by the classifiers.
	
	b.) The best performing class labels are CTRL, FAIR, GPT, PPLM, XLM, and XLNET. These are the classes for which most of the classifiers generated good f1 scores:

These language models were trained on different datasets and using different architectures, which may result in differences in the style and quality of the text they generate. The differences in the generated text could be reflected in the features extracted by the classifiers, which may make it easier for the classifiers to distinguish between them.

Additionally, some of these language models, such as GPT and XLNet, have been pre-trained on large datasets using unsupervised learning techniques. This pre-training may have helped to capture higher-level patterns in the text, which could have made it easier for the classifiers to distinguish between them.

	c.) The Parallel CNN model has the highest overall accuracy of 80%, followed by the LSTM model with 79%. This means:

The Parallel CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers with different kernel sizes that operate in parallel on the input sentences. This allows the model to extract different types of features from the sentences, such as n-grams, word embeddings, and semantic relations. The LSTM model consists of a recurrent layer that can process the sentences sequentially and capture the long-term dependencies and context of the words. Both of these models are good at capturing the general features of the sentences that can help them distinguish between different sources, such as vocabulary, style, tone, and structure.

	d.) The RNN-GRU model has the lowest accuracy of 75%, which could indicate that it is not suitable for this task or that it needs more tuning or regularization:

The RNN-GRU model consists of a recurrent layer with gated recurrent units (GRUs) that can process the sentences sequentially and capture the long-term dependencies and context of the words. However, this model may not be suitable for this task because it may not be able to capture the subtle differences between different sources that are more related to the features of the sentences than the sequence of the words. For example, two sentences may have the same words but different punctuation, capitalization, or word order, which may indicate different sources. The RNN-GRU model may not be able to detect these differences as well as the other models.

2.) Why BERT performed well on GPT2 and detected better on Task - 3 for GPT3 and InstructGPT?

Some data sources may be more similar to the BERT model in terms of vocabulary, style, tone, and structure, making them easier to classify. For example, GPT2, GPT3, and INSTRUCTGPT are also pre-trained language models that have been trained on large corpora of text and can generate sentences that are coherent and fluent. These sources may share some common features with the BERT model that make them more distinguishable from the other sources. Moreover, some sources may have more examples in the data than the other sources, giving the model more information to learn from. For example, GPT2, GPT3, and INSTRUCTGPT are popular and widely used language models that may have more sentences generated by them than the other sources. These sources may provide more data for the BERT-based model to train on and improve its performance.

3.) Why TfIDF + XGBoost combo outperformed all classifiers including BERT based model?

The XGBoost classifier is a gradient boosting algorithm that can build an ensemble of decision trees that can learn from the errors of the previous trees and improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. This algorithm can handle different types of data, such as numerical, categorical, or textual, and can capture the non-linear and complex relationships between the features and the target variable. This algorithm can also avoid overfitting or underfitting by using regularization techniques, such as shrinkage, pruning, or early stopping.

Also, some data sources may use more rare or specific words than others, which may indicate their source. The TfIDF vectorizer can assign higher weights to these words and make them more prominent for the classifier. The other classifiers, such as the BERT-based model, may not be able to capture these features as well as the TfIDF vectorizer because they may focus more on the meaning of the words than their importance or frequency. The other classifiers, such as the deep learning models, may not be able to use these features as efficiently as the TfIDF vectorizer because they may need more data or processing power to learn from them.

4.) Why POS Tagging reduced the classifier accuracy?

The POS tagging feature may introduce noise or redundancy in the data because it may not be accurate or consistent for all the sentences. For example, some sentences may have ambiguous or incorrect parts of speech that may confuse the classifier or make it less confident. Some sentences may have similar or identical parts of speech that may not provide any additional information for the classifier or make it more complex.

This is because different types of features may have different scales, distributions, or representations that may affect the performance of the classifier. For example:

Different scales: Some features may have a large range of values while others may have a small range of values. This may cause some features to dominate or overshadow others in the classifier. For example, the TfIDF vectorizer may assign values between 0 and 1 to each word in the sentence, while the POS tagging feature may assign values of 0 or 1 to each part of speech in the sentence. This may make the TfIDF feature more influential or important than the POS tagging feature in the classifier.

Different distributions: Some features may have a normal or uniform distribution while others may have a skewed or imbalanced distribution. This may cause some features to have more variability or diversity than others in the classifier. For example, the POS tagging feature may have a skewed distribution because some parts of speech may be more common or frequent than others in the sentences. This may make the POS tagging feature less informative or useful than the other features in the classifier.

Different representations: Some features may have a numerical or continuous representation while others may have a categorical or binary representation. This may make it harder for the classifier to combine or compare the features and make accurate predictions. For example, the POS tagging feature may have a categorical representation because it assigns a discrete label to each part of speech in the sentence, while the other features may have a numerical representation because they assign a continuous value to each word or sentence. This may make it harder for the classifier to measure the similarity or difference between the features and make accurate predictions.
